  details: "An introductory course to the field of machine learning, covering the foundations of statistical learning, and the applicability of machine learning to real world problems.
We focus on the PAC model, addressing fundamental questions like: What is machine learning? What type of concepts are learnable? How can we learn from data? We build a machine learning toolbox, learning the foundations and implementation of linear regression, various classifiers (SVM, decision trees, logistic regression), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction), ensembles, and deep learning (gradient descent and neural network architectures), as well as overarching concepts such as the bias-variance tradeoff and regularization."
